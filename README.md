## To check the performance you can directly open the .html file


## Objectives for this project

1. When `index.html` is opened in the browser, the content of constant `USERS` in `json/data.js` will appear as a table on the browser. Table column order should be the same as the order already written in `index.html`.
    - Show the user’s full name in the “Name” column, in `last name, first names` order. Including a comma and space between the two names.
2. When `button#start` is clicked, table rows will be shuffled in a new, random order once every second.
3. The process in 2 will stop when `button#stop` is clicked.
4. When the user’s full name is very long, truncate it and show an ellipsis. (Use your judgment about how long “very long” is.)
5. When `button#sort` is clicked, rows will be sorted - first by balance, in descending order, and second by user ID, in ascending order. That is, if multiple rows have the same balance, order those rows with the same balance amount by ID.
6. When the randomized shuffle process is enabled, disable `button#sort`.
7. Use bootstrap’s classes to give elements meaningful styling.
